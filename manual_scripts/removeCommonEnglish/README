remove.php

Overview.
Given a source S, display such words that do not already appear in the three
skiplists G, O or P.

Usage:
- via standard input
cat <source> | php remove.php [-g|--general-words <dict>] [-o|--or-words <dict>]
 [-p|--personal-words <dict>]
- via file
php remove.php [-g|--general-words <dict>] [-o|--or-words <dict>]
 [-p|--personal-words <dict>] [-s|--source <file>]

That source S might, for instance, be a transcript.

The three skiplists are:
G: words that are common because they appear in a standard dictionary. I use a
dictionary formed of both British and American spellings
O: words we already track because they appear as a Thing in the database
P: words that I know I don't want to track

Words that survive to be displayed may represent the name of something we should
investigate and either add as a Thing to the database, or add to the P skiplist
as something we want to ignore.


Before initial use.
Program needs a copy of English words it can safely ignore. On my (old) copy of
Linux, I used:
$ cat /usr/share/dict/british-english /usr/share/dict/american-english | sort \
-u -o uk-us-english-2011
Which forms a single flat file of unique British and American words.


Workflow.
1. Obtain latest or-words by running
$ php manual_scripts/display-or-words.php btc >/tmp/or-words
2. Run against remove.php as above
$ cat /tmp/email | php remove.php -g uk-us-english-2011 --or-words \
 "/tmp/or-words" --personal-words my-words

3. For each entry on the resulting list should be
   a. Add as a new thing to or.sh if it is Interesting. Entry will be:
      i. Excluded from following runs
      ii. Available in or.sh
   b. Add to my-words if it is Not Interesting. Will be:
      i. Excluded from following runs
   c. Research
      i. Examine context of original use. Spyllchucked? Add to my-words
      ii. Novel use such as a name? Add to or.sh
   d. cat my-words | sort -u -o my-words
